  <h2>fuzzydoDB (Fuzzy Domains Data Bases)</h2>
  <p> 
  
   is a project initiated by professors of the Computer Science and Information Technology Department  at Universidad Simón Bolívar whose development is currently undertaken by Computer Engineering students of the same institute. </p>
  
  <p>
  The aim of the project is to specify, store and query databases with fuzzy attributes in the hopes it will ultimately enable the corroboration of theoretic results that have been attained in the field of study.

          <p>fuzzydoDB (Fuzzy Domains Data Bases) is a project initiated by 
             professors of the Computer Science and Information Technology 
             Department at Universidad Simon Bolivar whose development is 
             currently undertaken by Computer Engineering students of the same 
             institute. The aim of the project is to provide a prototype that 
             allows users to specify, store and query databases with fuzzy 
             attributes in the hopes it will ultimately enable the corroboration 
             of theoretic results that have been attained in the field of study. 
             This web application was designed for illustrative purposes only, 
             to display the functioning features of the prototype on small study 
             cases.</p>
